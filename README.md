## API Usage

### Users
#### Signup
To create a user account make a `POST` request to `/auth/signup`. The request body should contain:
```json
{
    "email": "johndoe@mail.com",
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "password": "somepassword",
    "passwordConfirm": "somepassword"
}
```
The server responds with a status and an access token:
```json
{
	"status": "success",
	"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6OCwiaWF0IjoxNTMwODY1NjgyLCJleHAiOjE1MzA5NTIwODJ9.TBCD0rXVGEM5Yez5hnWGUc0VFSot3kP5eVRXdqg1PGA"
}
```
#### Sign-in
To sign in a previously registered account make a `POST` request to `/auth/login`. The request body should contain:
```json
{
    "email": "johndoe@mail.com",
    "password": "somepassword"
}
```
The server responds with a status and an access token:
```json
{
	"status": "success",
	"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6OCwiaWF0IjoxNTMwODY1NjgyLCJleHAiOjE1MzA5NTIwODJ9.TBCD0rXVGEM5Yez5hnWGUc0VFSot3kP5eVRXdqg1PGA"
}
```

The token obtained from authentication above must be sent to all other protected routes in the request `Authorization` header in the form along with whatever payload:
```json
"Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6OCwiaWF0IjoxNTMwODY1NjgyLCJleHAiOjE1MzA5NTIwODJ9.TBCD0rXVGEM5Yez5hnWGUc0VFSot3kP5eVRXdqg1PGA"
